I am a full stack developer with 5 years of relevant work experience in C#.Net, MS SQL, Javascript, AJAX, JQuery. I have worked in the banking domain for clients in Philippines and UAE; I whave 1+ years of international on-site experience. I have also worked on a project in Java a few years back so I am comfortable with Java if and when required.
I was a Team Lead in my organisation so I have been exposed to various parts of the Software Life Cycle including Requirement gathering, designing, development, maintenance and client interaction as well.

I would like to get expertise in React and Agile during the course as those would definitely add perfectly to my skillset.
