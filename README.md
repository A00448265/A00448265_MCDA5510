This Assignment project consists of a DLL (Assignment1) and Console Application (ConsoleAssignment). The program traverses a folder structure, skips the records with any blank value and writes the data into Output/Output.csv.
It also logs the skipped records (Folder,file name, row number) in logs folder. (Used log4net for logging)
Execution time, counted and skipped records have been logged in both csv file as well as logs.

To change the destination: 
1. Go to ConsoleAssignment\App.Config and change key value of filename. (in case code will be compiled)
2. Go to ConsoleAssignment\bin\Debug\net5.0\App.config and change the key value of filename (in case need to run without compiling the code)

For logging, Log4net has been used.

My name is Rohan Vashist and I am a full stack developer with 5+ years of relevant work experience in C#.Net, MS SQL, Javascript, AJAX, JQuery. I have worked in the banking domain for clients in Philippines and UAE; I have 1+ years of international on-site experience. I have also worked on a project in Java a few years back so I am comfortable with Java if and when required.
I was a Team Lead in my organisation so I have been exposed to various parts of the Software Life Cycle including Requirement gathering, designing, development, maintenance and client interaction as well.

I would like to get expertise in React and Agile during the course as those would definitely add perfectly to my skillset.
